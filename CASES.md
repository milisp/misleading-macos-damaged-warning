#### GitHub Issues

1.  **App or Context:** Electron app (specifically, `electron-userland/electron-builder`)

      * **User Report Summary:** Users are consistently getting the "App is damaged and can't be opened. You should move it to the Bin." error when trying to open macOS builds created with Electron Builder. This is occurring on newer macOS versions and Apple Silicon.
      * **Possible Cause:** App not notarized by Apple. Gatekeeper's stricter requirements for distributions on Apple Silicon.

2.  **App or Context:** Actual Budget (Electron app)

      * **User Report Summary:** The `Actual` application, an Electron app, is presenting the "damaged" error, preventing it from opening.
      * **Possible Cause:** Likely related to missing notarization or code signing issues, common with Electron apps not properly signed for macOS.

3.  **App or Context:** airi (likely an Electron or similar desktop app)

      * **User Report Summary:** Users are encountering the "airi Is Damaged and Can't Be Opened. You Should Move It To The Trash" message when attempting to launch the `airi` application.
      * **Possible Cause:** Unsigned or un-notarized application, triggering Gatekeeper.

4.  **App or Context:** NeoPlayer (likely a desktop media player)

      * **User Report Summary:** The `NeoPlayer` application is displaying the "damaged" error message on macOS, preventing users from opening it.
      * **Possible Cause:** Absence of proper code signing or Apple notarization for the application.
      * **Link to Original Source:** [https://github.com/lucmsilva651/NeoPlayer/issues/1](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://github.com/lucmsilva651/NeoPlayer/issues/1) (mentioned within electron-userland/electron-builder\#8191)

5.  **App or Context:** NW.js application

      * **User Report Summary:** An NW.js app consistently shows the "damaged" warning on macOS Sonoma, even when attempting to open via right-click "Open," which usually bypasses some Gatekeeper checks.
      * **Possible Cause:** Missing notarization; macOS adds a "quarantined" attribute to internet downloads, and NW.js apps might be particularly susceptible to this strict check.

6.  **App or Context:** Generic .dmg files/applications

      * **User Report Summary:** Users are unable to open applications downloaded via .dmg files, consistently receiving the "---.dmg is damaged and can't be opened. You should move it to the Trash." error. Attempts to use `spctl --master-disable` and "Allow Apps Downloaded from Anywhere" in security settings did not resolve the issue.
      * **Possible Cause:** Persistent `com.apple.quarantine` flag, or potential deeper system corruption/migration issues (one user reported it after migrating data to a new M4 Mac).

7.  **App or Context:** DeskThing

      * **User Report Summary:** User reports "DeskThing" is damaged and can't be opened, suggesting it be moved to the Trash. Resolves it by running `sudo xattr -r -d com.apple.quarantine /Applications/DeskThing.app`.
      * **Possible Cause:** The `com.apple.quarantine` flag was applied to the downloaded application, preventing it from opening due to Gatekeeper.

      * **User Report Summary:** User reports "Fightcade2 is damaged and can't be opened. you should move it to trash" error.
      * **Possible Cause:** Likely the `com.apple.quarantine` attribute, or lack of proper code signing/notarization.

12. **App or Context:** Generic App (e.g., "App.app," "Lovable.app," "Grammarly.app" - often Chrome-based apps)

      * **User Report Summary:** After installing an app (especially not from the App Store or unverified developers, or Chrome-based), the error "App.app" is damaged and can't be opened. You should move it to the Bin." appears. The user often clicks "Cancel" and then finds a message in System Settings \> Privacy & Security to "Open Anyway."
      * **Possible Cause:** App not signed or notarized by an Apple-verified developer, or downloaded via a browser, triggering Gatekeeper's strict security. The `com.apple.quarantine` flag is implicitly the root cause.

13. **App or Context:** StatPlanet interactive mapping application

      * **User Report Summary:** When opening the `StatPlanet Mac` application, users receive the "file is damaged" message. The recommended fix involves enabling "Allow applications downloaded from: Anywhere" in Security & Privacy.
      * **Possible Cause:** Gatekeeper preventing the execution of an unsigned application downloaded from the internet. The `com.apple.quarantine` flag is at play.

14. **App or Context:** Various applications, often after a macOS update

      * **User Report Summary:** User reports that after a recent macOS update, "The file is most certainly not damaged as I can install fonts by dragging in to FontBook and open files thru respective program." but still gets the "is damaged and can't be opened" message for other apps. Suggests the `xattr -c <path/to/application.app>` command.
      * **Possible Cause:** The `com.apple.quarantine` extended attribute, applied to downloaded files, is the primary trigger. Less likely to be actual file corruption.

15. **App or Context:** Xcode (specifically Xcode 6.1.1 on Yosemite, or newer versions)

      * **User Report Summary:** Users encounter "Xcode is damaged and can't be opened. You should move it to the Trash" when trying to launch Xcode, particularly after downloading it from a DMG instead of the App Store. Some reported it crashing when building/running in the simulator.
      * **Possible Cause:** Gatekeeper's restrictions on unsigned/unverified applications (even Xcode if not from App Store), `com.apple.quarantine` flag. In some cases, actual corruption of derived data or simulator files.

16. **App or Context:** Xamarin.Forms macOS apps (during development/reproductions)

      * **User Report Summary:** Developer encounters "appname.app is damaged and can't be opened. You should move it to the Bin" on macOS Catalina when running Xamarin.Forms reproductions. macOS appears to detect binaries built from code and applies the quarantine attribute.
      * **Possible Cause:** `com.apple.quarantine` attribute applied even to locally built applications, due to macOS's stricter protection measures since Catalina.

17. **App or Context:** Xojo-built applications (Universal Build)

      * **User Report Summary:** A Xojo developer reports users getting the "app is damaged and can't be opened. You should move it to the Trash" message, particularly on Intel Macs (initially thought to be M-chip specific). Right-click "Open" doesn't work for "damaged" apps.
      * **Possible Cause:** App not signed and notarized. Apple's increased requirements now lead to this "damaged" message even for unsigned apps, rather than just a quarantine warning. Bundle modification after signing.

18. **App or Context:** Coherence Pro (and other apps after macOS Catalina update)

      * **User Report Summary:** User found several apps not working after updating to macOS Catalina, specifically `Coherence Pro`, with the "damaged and can't be opened" error.
      * **Possible Cause:** `com.apple.quarantine` attribute. The solution found was `sudo xattr -rds com.apple.quarantine /Applications/Coherence\ Pro.app`.
      * **Link to Original Source:** [https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/372084/macos-catalina-app-is-damaged-and-cant-be-opened-you-should-move-it-to-the-t](https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/372084/macos-catalina-app-is-damaged-and-cant-be-opened-you-should-move-it-to-the-t)

19. **App or Context:** DeepL app

      * **User Report Summary:** User experienced the "damaged app" problem with the DeepL app on MacBook Ventura. Removing from Trash helped, but redownloading from the website led to issues, possibly because the default download was for Big Sur.
      * **Possible Cause:** Possibly the `com.apple.quarantine` flag. Also, potentially an incompatibility with the macOS version if the downloaded app is compiled for an older OS.
      * **Link to Original Source:** [https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/466173/how-to-fix-a-damaged-app-error-message-when-the-app-cant-be-found](https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/466173/how-to-fix-a-damaged-app-error-message-when-the-app-cant-be-found)

20. **App or Context:** General files/applications (Apple Support Communities)

      * **User Report Summary:** User reports that all files give "The file is damaged and should be moved to the trash" error, even after setting "Allow applications downloaded from" to "App store and identified developers" (which kept reverting). Opening files from within an application's open dialog works, but not from Finder.
      * **Possible Cause:** Deep-seated permissions issues, or a corrupt security preference database. The `com.apple.quarantine` attribute is a likely trigger, but the persistence suggests a system-wide problem.
