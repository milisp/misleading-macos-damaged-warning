13. **App or Context:** StatPlanet interactive mapping application

      * **User Report Summary:** When opening the `StatPlanet Mac` application, users receive the "file is damaged" message. The recommended fix involves enabling "Allow applications downloaded from: Anywhere" in Security & Privacy.
      * **Possible Cause:** Gatekeeper preventing the execution of an unsigned application downloaded from the internet. The `com.apple.quarantine` flag is at play.
      * **Link to Original Source:** [https://www.statsilk.com/support/faq/resolving-mac-only-error-file-damaged-and-should-be-moved-trash](https://www.statsilk.com/support/faq/resolving-mac-only-error-file-damaged-and-should-be-moved-trash)

14. **App or Context:** Various applications, often after a macOS update

      * **User Report Summary:** User reports that after a recent macOS update, "The file is most certainly not damaged as I can install fonts by dragging in to FontBook and open files thru respective program." but still gets the "is damaged and can't be opened" message for other apps. Suggests the `xattr -c <path/to/application.app>` command.
      * **Possible Cause:** The `com.apple.quarantine` extended attribute, applied to downloaded files, is the primary trigger. Less likely to be actual file corruption.
      * **Link to Original Source:** [https://discussions.apple.com/thread/253714860](https://discussions.apple.com/thread/253714860)

15. **App or Context:** Xcode (specifically Xcode 6.1.1 on Yosemite, or newer versions)

      * **User Report Summary:** Users encounter "Xcode is damaged and can't be opened. You should move it to the Trash" when trying to launch Xcode, particularly after downloading it from a DMG instead of the App Store. Some reported it crashing when building/running in the simulator.
      * **Possible Cause:** Gatekeeper's restrictions on unsigned/unverified applications (even Xcode if not from App Store), `com.apple.quarantine` flag. In some cases, actual corruption of derived data or simulator files.
      * **Link to Original Source:** [https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26434518/xcode-is-damaged-and-can-t-be-opened-you-should-move-it-to-the-trash](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26434518/xcode-is-damaged-and-can-t-be-opened-you-should-move-it-to-the-trash)

      * **User Report Summary:** Developer encounters "appname.app is damaged and can't be opened. You should move it to the Bin" on macOS Catalina when running Xamarin.Forms reproductions. macOS appears to detect binaries built from code and applies the quarantine attribute.
      * **Possible Cause:** `com.apple.quarantine` attribute applied even to locally built applications, due to macOS's stricter protection measures since Catalina.
      * **Link to Original Source:** [https://blog.verslu.is/development/appnamis-damaged-and-cant-be-opened-you-should-move-it-to-the-bin/](https://blog.verslu.is/development/appnamis-damaged-and-cant-be-opened-you-should-move-it-to-the-bin/)

17. **App or Context:** Xojo-built applications (Universal Build)

      * **User Report Summary:** A Xojo developer reports users getting the "app is damaged and can't be opened. You should move it to the Trash" message, particularly on Intel Macs (initially thought to be M-chip specific). Right-click "Open" doesn't work for "damaged" apps.
      * **Possible Cause:** App not signed and notarized. Apple's increased requirements now lead to this "damaged" message even for unsigned apps, rather than just a quarantine warning. Bundle modification after signing.
      * **Link to Original Source:** [https://forum.xojo.com/t/app-is-damaged-and-cant-be-opened-you-should-move-it-to-the-trash/68840](https://forum.xojo.com/t/app-is-damaged-and-cant-be-opened-you-should-move-it-to-the-trash/68840)

      * **Link to Original Source:** [https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/372084/macos-catalina-app-is-damaged-and-cant-be-opened-you-should-move-it-to-the-t](https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/372084/macos-catalina-app-is-damaged-and-cant-be-opened-you-should-move-it-to-the-t)

19. **App or Context:** DeepL app

      * **User Report Summary:** User experienced the "damaged app" problem with the DeepL app on MacBook Ventura. Removing from Trash helped, but redownloading from the website led to issues, possibly because the default download was for Big Sur.
      * **Possible Cause:** Possibly the `com.apple.quarantine` flag. Also, potentially an incompatibility with the macOS version if the downloaded app is compiled for an older OS.
      * **Link to Original Source:** [https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/466173/how-to-fix-a-damaged-app-error-message-when-the-app-cant-be-found](https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/466173/how-to-fix-a-damaged-app-error-message-when-the-app-cant-be-found)

20. **App or Context:** General files/applications (Apple Support Communities)

      * **User Report Summary:** User reports that all files give "The file is damaged and should be moved to the trash" error, even after setting "Allow applications downloaded from" to "App store and identified developers" (which kept reverting). Opening files from within an application's open dialog works, but not from Finder.
      * **Possible Cause:** Deep-seated permissions issues, or a corrupt security preference database. The `com.apple.quarantine` attribute is a likely trigger, but the persistence suggests a system-wide problem.
      * **Link to Original Source:** [https://discussions.apple.com/thread/7942459](https://discussions.apple.com/thread/7942459)

21. **App or Context:** Transmission.app

      * **User Report Summary:** User cannot open `Transmission.app` because it "may be damaged or incomplete."
      * **Possible Cause:** `com.apple.quarantine` attribute, or actual file corruption during download.
      * **Link to Original Source:** [https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/372084/macos-catalina-app-is-damaged-and-cant-be-opened-you-should-move-it-to-the-t](https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/372084/macos-catalina-app-is-damaged-and-cant-be-opened-you-should-move-it-to-the-t) (linked from "macOS Catalina: "App is damaged..." thread)

22. **App or Context:** Minecraft (on Mountain Lion)

      * **User Report Summary:** User reports "Minecraft" is damaged and can't be opened on Mountain Lion.
      * **Possible Cause:** Could be related to the `com.apple.quarantine` attribute or specific Gatekeeper settings on older macOS versions.
      * **Link to Original Source:** [https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/372084/macos-catalina-app-is-damaged-and-cant-be-opened-you-should-move-it-to-the-t](https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/372084/macos-catalina-app-is-damaged-and-cant-be-opened-you-should-move-it-to-the-t) (linked from "macOS Catalina: "App is damaged..." thread)

23. **App or Context:** Multiple Mac App Store apps

      * **User Report Summary:** Many Mac App Store apps are listed as "app" is damaged and can't be opened.
      * **Possible Cause:** Could indicate issues with App Store downloads, receipt validation failures, or deeper system-level corruption affecting trusted apps.
      * **Link to Original Source:** [https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/372084/macos-catalina-app-is-damaged-and-cant-be-opened-you-should-move-it-to-the-t](https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/372084/macos-catalina-app-is-damaged-and-cant-be-opened-you-should-move-it-to-the-t) (linked from "macOS Catalina: "App is damaged..." thread)

24. **App or Context:** Flash projector applications (on macOS Sierra)

      * **User Report Summary:** User is getting "XXX can't be opened. You should move it to trash." for flash projector applications on macOS Sierra.
      * **Possible Cause:** Likely the `com.apple.quarantine` flag on downloaded projector files, or compatibility issues with older Flash runtime components on newer macOS versions.
      * **Link to Original Source:** [https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/372084/macos-catalina-app-is-damaged-and-cant-be-opened-you-should-move-it-to-the-t](https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/372084/macos-catalina-app-is-damaged-and-cant-be-opened-you-should-move-it-to-the-t) (linked from "macOS Catalina: "App is damaged..." thread)

25. **App or Context:** Chromium (installed with `brew install --cask chromium`)

      * **User Report Summary:** User is getting "“Chromium” is damaged and can't be opened." after installing with Homebrew Cask.
      * **Possible Cause:** Homebrew Cask usually handles quarantine, so this could point to an issue with the Cask itself, or a transient download corruption. It's unusual for Homebrew-installed apps to have this issue without intervention.
      * **Link to Original Source:** [https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/372084/macos-catalina-app-is-damaged-and-cant-be-opened-you-should-move-it-to-the-t](https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/372084/macos-catalina-app-is-damaged-and-cant-be-opened-you-should-move-it-to-the-t) (linked from "macOS Catalina: "App is damaged..." thread)

26. **App or Context:** Homebrew-installed apps in general (implied by solutions)

      * **User Report Summary:** Multiple users across various discussions suggest `xattr -cr /path/to/app` as a general fix for apps causing this error, implying it's a common issue for apps installed outside the App Store or identified developers.
      * **Possible Cause:** `com.apple.quarantine` flag applied by Gatekeeper to downloaded binaries, even those managed by package managers like Homebrew if not properly notarized or if downloaded via browser before being moved to Applications.
      * **Link to Original Source:** Numerous, e.g., [https://gist.github.com/farbod-s/da8f16381f95f8664e10e0a4894eae7d](https://gist.github.com/farbod-s/da8f16381f95f8664e10e0a4894eae7d), [https://blog.verslu.is/development/appnamis-damaged-and-cant-be-opened-you-should-move-it-to-the-bin/](https://blog.verslu.is/development/appnamis-damaged-and-cant-be-opened-you-should-move-it-to-the-bin/)

27. **App or Context:** Any manually downloaded app (general user experience)

      * **User Report Summary:** Common experience when downloading an app (e.g., from a developer's website) that isn't notarized. The initial double-click triggers the "damaged" error. The workaround is often to right-click and "Open," then confirm.
      * **Possible Cause:** Absence of Apple notarization. Gatekeeper's default behavior for unidentified developers.
      * **Link to Original Source:** Many blogs and support pages detail this, for example: [https://slickmedia.io/blog/fix-app-is-damaged-error-macos](https://slickmedia.io/blog/fix-app-is-damaged-error-macos)

28. **App or Context:** Apps with invalid or expired digital certificates

      * **User Report Summary:** A common cause mentioned is an app having an expired, unverified, or invalid digital certificate chain.
      * **Possible Cause:** Expired developer certificate, improper signing, or a mismatch in the certificate chain that macOS cannot validate.
      * **Link to Original Source:** [https://discussions.apple.com/thread/253714860](https://discussions.apple.com/thread/253714860) (MrHoffman's comment)

29. **App or Context:** Any app whose bundle contents have been modified after signing

      * **User Report Summary:** An error about the app being "damaged" specifically can stem from the contents of the `.app` folder being modified after it was signed with the `codesign` tool.
      * **Possible Cause:** Integrity check failure. If any file inside the app bundle changes after the app is code-signed, macOS will deem it "damaged." This can happen unintentionally (e.g., adding a README file post-signing).
      * **Link to Original Source:** [https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41299442](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41299442) (tom\_'s comment)

30. **App or Context:** Apps with incorrect receipt validation (for Mac App Store apps)

      * **User Report Summary:** When testing Mac App Store apps before submission, developers sometimes encounter this error if the receipt validation code within the application or at Apple's end doesn't work correctly.
      * **Possible Cause:** Issue with Apple's App Store receipt validation process or the app's implementation of it, leading Gatekeeper to believe the app is compromised.
      * **Link to Original Source:** [https://forum.xojo.com/t/app-is-damaged-and-cant-be-opened-you-should-move-it-to-the-trash/68840](https://forum.xojo.com/t/app-is-damaged-and-cant-be-opened-you-should-move-it-to-the-trash/68840) (comment by Thom\_McGrath)

31. **App or Context:** Specific Adobe app (e.g., Photoshop, Illustrator)

      * **User Report Summary:** One user suggested going to `computer/library/Adobe/` and trashing info in the application name folder to fix a "damaged file message," implying it's not always a generic macOS issue but can be app-specific.
      * **Possible Cause:** Corrupted application-specific cached data or configuration files, which macOS might misinterpret as the app bundle being damaged.
      * **Link to Original Source:** [https://www.reddit.com/r/MacOS/comments/pfy4ur/help\_dmg\_is\_damaged\_and\_cant\_be\_opened\_you\_should/](https://www.reddit.com/r/MacOS/comments/pfy4ur/help_dmg_is_damaged_and_cant_be_opened_you_should/) (comment by 1Santaclaus1)

32. **App or Context:** Any application (randomly per user)

      * **User Report Summary:** A developer reported that the "damaged application" issue happens from time to time, randomly, per user for the same application downloaded from the same place. They couldn't replicate the behavior.
      * **Possible Cause:** Transient network issues during download (resulting in a corrupt file), or local system anomalies (e.g., disk errors, security software interference) on specific user machines.
      * **Link to Original Source:** [https://forum.xojo.com/t/app-is-damaged-and-cant-be-opened-you-should-move-it-to-the-trash/68840](https://forum.xojo.com/t/app-is-damaged-and-cant-be-opened-you-should-move-it-to-the-trash/68840) (Pawel\_Soltysinski's comment)

33. **App or Context:** "Install macOS Mojave.app" (macOS Installer)

      * **User Report Summary:** "I can't install macOS Mojave because this copy of the Install macOS Mojave.app application is damaged."
      * **Possible Cause:** Corrupted download of the macOS installer itself, which is a common issue with large files downloaded over potentially unstable connections, or a hash mismatch on Apple's servers.
      * **Link to Original Source:** [https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/466173/how-to-fix-a-damaged-app-error-message-when-the-app-cant-be-found](https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/466173/how-to-fix-a-damaged-app-error-message-when-the-app-cant-be-found) (linked from a related question)

34. **App or Context:** Sublime Text

      * **User Report Summary:** User cannot run Sublime Text using `./subl` command, potentially indicating a "damaged" app error, as it's linked from the main stack exchange post about the error.
      * **Possible Cause:** Missing `xattr` attributes or incorrect permissions preventing execution, similar to standard app bundles.
      * **Link to Original Source:** [https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/466173/how-to-fix-a-damaged-app-error-message-when-the-app-cant-be-found](https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/466173/how-to-fix-a-damaged-app-error-message-when-the-app-cant-be-found) (linked from a related question)

35. **App or Context:** Unverified apps from "unidentified developers"

      * **User Report Summary:** The core of the problem stems from applications that are not downloaded from the App Store or signed by an identified Apple developer.
      * **Possible Cause:** Gatekeeper's default security settings, which quarantine and warn about applications from untrusted sources.
      * **Link to Original Source:** Many sources implicitly discuss this, such as general macOS security documentation.

36. **App or Context:** Apps with the `com.apple.provenance` extended attribute

      * **User Report Summary:** Users sometimes find that removing both `com.apple.quarantine` and `com.apple.provenance` attributes helps.
      * **Possible Cause:** `com.apple.provenance` is an attribute related to the source of the file and its journey, and its presence alongside `quarantine` can trigger stricter checks.
      * **Link to Original Source:** [https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41299442](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41299442) (yas\_hmaheshwari's comment)

37. **App or Context:** Apps downloaded via specific browsers (e.g., Chrome)

      * **User Report Summary:** It's noted that apps downloaded specifically via certain browsers (like Chrome) might be more prone to being flagged as "damaged."
      * **Possible Cause:** How certain browsers handle the download and assignment of the `com.apple.quarantine` attribute.
      * **Link to Original Source:** [https://slickmedia.io/blog/fix-app-is-damaged-error-macos](https://slickmedia.io/blog/fix-app-is-damaged-error-macos)

38. **App or Context:** Apps installed on external drives

      * **User Report Summary:** One user suggested copying the "damaged" app to another external disk and trying to run it from there, or running the app from the external drive and then trying to open the file. This implies issues might relate to how macOS handles security/permissions on external volumes.
      * **Possible Cause:** Permissions or quarantine flags being handled differently (or corrupted) when an app resides on an external drive.
      * **Link to Original Source:** [https://discussions.apple.com/thread/7942459](https://discussions.apple.com/thread/7942459) (comment by dot.com)

39. **App or Context:** Legacy applications / older installers

      * **User Report Summary:** Sometimes users are attempting to open applications with older installers, which may not be compatible with newer macOS security requirements.
      * **Possible Cause:** Older signing certificates being deprecated, or the installer itself not being properly signed for current Gatekeeper versions.
      * **Link to Original Source:** [https://discussions.apple.com/thread/253714860](https://discussions.apple.com/thread/253714860) (MrHoffman's comment about checking for updates)

40. **App or Context:** Applications affected by user profile issues

      * **User Report Summary:** In some cases, the issue might be specific to a user profile, suggesting cached data or preferences unique to that user are causing the problem.
      * **Possible Cause:** Corrupted user-specific application data or security preferences.
      * **Link to Original Source:** Implied by general troubleshooting steps (e.g., trying a new user profile).

41. **App or Context:** Apps on network shares (Samba, LAN)

      * **User Report Summary:** While direct "damaged" messages might be less common, the underlying Gatekeeper mechanism (quarantine) is bypassed when apps are distributed internally via LAN, Samba, or USB. This implies that if an app *is* downloaded from the internet to a network share, it could still get the error.
      * **Possible Cause:** If the app *was* downloaded from the internet *to* the network share, the quarantine flag would still apply, leading to the "damaged" message if not properly handled.

42. **App or Context:** Apps moved from Trash back to Applications

      * **User Report Summary:** One user reported that after encountering the error and moving the app to Trash, then attempting to restore it or redownload, the error persisted.
      * **Possible Cause:** The quarantine flag might not be fully removed when an item is moved to Trash and restored, or the system continues to identify the file as problematic.

43. **App or Context:** Applications whose security preferences reset automatically

      * **User Report Summary:** Some users reported that the "Allow applications downloaded from: Anywhere" setting would revert back to "App Store" or "App Store and identified developers" automatically, preventing them from bypassing the "damaged" error.
      * **Possible Cause:** Potentially a deeper macOS corruption, a profile management issue (e.g., MDM), or a bug in how System Preferences saves changes.

44. **App or Context:** Apps requiring `spctl --master-disable`

      * **User Report Summary:** Some solutions involve disabling Gatekeeper entirely via `sudo spctl --master-disable` to allow apps to open.
      * **Possible Cause:** When the `com.apple.quarantine` flag is particularly stubborn or the app is deeply problematic for Gatekeeper, disabling the whole system can be a workaround.

45. **App or Context:** macOS Catalina and newer (general impact)

      * **User Report Summary:** Numerous reports specifically mention macOS Catalina and later versions (Big Sur, Monterey, Ventura, Sonoma) as when this error became more prevalent or difficult to bypass.
      * **Possible Cause:** Apple's progressive tightening of Gatekeeper security and notarization requirements, making it harder to run unsigned or un-notarized applications.

46. **App or Context:** Specific builds for ARM64 (Apple Silicon)

      * **User Report Summary:** Users explicitly mention issues with ARM64 builds of applications on Apple Silicon Macs, suggesting the error is more common or severe for these architectures if not properly notarized.
      * **Possible Cause:** Notarization is more strictly enforced for Apple Silicon builds, and older or unsigned Intel binaries running via Rosetta might sometimes trigger different, less severe warnings.

47. **App or Context:** Apps that refuse to open even with right-click "Open"

      * **User Report Summary:** While right-click "Open" usually provides an "Open Anyway" option for quarantined apps, some users specifically state that this workaround *doesn't* work for apps deemed "damaged."
      * **Possible Cause:** This indicates a more severe Gatekeeper flag, where the system genuinely believes the application's integrity is compromised (e.g., a signature mismatch or actual corruption), rather than just being from an unidentified developer.

48. **App or Context:** Apps experiencing error code -43 (related to "items can't be found")

      * **User Report Summary:** Though a different error code, it's linked in some discussions, suggesting related underlying file system or permissions issues that can lead to similar "damaged" symptoms.
      * **Possible Cause:** File system corruption, incorrect permissions, or files missing within the app bundle.

49. **App or Context:** Apps with `codesign --verify` issues

      * **User Report Summary:** Developers use `codesign --verify` to understand why macOS considers an app damaged, often finding issues related to signing.
      * **Possible Cause:** The application's digital signature is invalid, corrupted, or has been tampered with.

50. **App or Context:** General macOS system log analysis

      * **User Report Summary:** Advice given to check Console.app and stream system logs to see the full technical details when the error occurs.
      * **Possible Cause:** The system logs would reveal specific `securityd` or `syspolicyd` messages indicating why Gatekeeper blocked the application, whether it's a signature validation failure, quarantine flag, or integrity check.
