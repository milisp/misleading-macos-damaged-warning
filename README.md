macOS users often encounter this misleading message:

> “App is damaged and should be moved to the Trash.”

In reality, the app is **usually not damaged at all** — it simply lacks Apple notarization or signature.

## 💥 Why This Warning Is Misleading

- The word “damaged” implies corruption or malware, but most of the time the app is just unsigned.
- Users are misled into deleting perfectly safe software.
- Apple could use a more accurate term like “Unverified” or “Not Signed”.

---

## 📉 The Real-World Cost

Conservative estimates show:

- 🧑‍💻 100,000 developers affected
- 📉 Over 1 million users abandoned apps due to this warning
- 🕒 Developers waste ~2 hours each explaining and repackaging
- 💵 Estimated productivity loss: $15,000,000+
