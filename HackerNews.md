title: Apple Has Wasted Millions of Developer and User Hours with a Misleading macOS Warning

Apple has knowingly used a misleading macOS error message for years:

> “App is damaged and should be moved to the Trash.”

In reality, the app is not damaged — it’s just unsigned or un-notarized. This message has misled countless users and wasted enormous time and trust.

## Why this matters

This isn’t a one-off bug. It’s a **system-level UX failure** that affects:
- ✅ Every unsigned open-source macOS app
- ✅ Every independent developer who can’t afford a $99/yr developer ID
- ✅ Every user who downloads a legitimate app from outside the App Store

Instead of a clear message like “This app is unsigned and may be unsafe”, Apple chose wording that implies **corruption or malware**. As a result:

## Real-world consequences

- 🧑‍💻 Developers spend hours responding to confused users
- 🛠️ Maintainers get blamed for Apple’s messaging
- 💬 Support forums are filled with misleading workarounds
- 🧓 Non-technical users lose access to safe, useful apps
- 🕰️ Time is lost — for everyone

> In one open-source tool I maintain, nearly 20% of support requests stem from this message. Each interaction — explaining, linking to a fix, writing docs — takes 10–30 minutes. Now scale that across thousands of apps.

And these are just the *visible* costs. The *invisible* cost is trust: developers abandon macOS targets; users give up on trying new tools.

## A single sentence, millions of wasted hours

Apple has had years to change this wording. They haven't.

This isn't just bad UX. It's neglect. And it's costing the ecosystem.
